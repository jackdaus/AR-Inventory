# If you need a new Icon, find and download one from Google's Material Icons!

# Guidlines for Adding New Icons
1.	Prefer Material Icons over Material Symbols
2.	Keep the downloaded file name the same (for future reference)
3.	Use PNG (SVG sprites aren't currently supported in StereoKit)
4.	If the download has x2 folder, use the PNG from that folder
5.	Download the WHITE icon for better visibility
6.	When copying a new file into Assets/icons don't forget to change the file
	property 'Copy to Output Directory' to 'Copy if newer'
